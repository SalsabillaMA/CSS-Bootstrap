            The energy crisis triggered by the increase in world oil prices has also crushed the lives of various layers
            of society in Indonesia, because the level of demand for fuel oil continues to increase, therefore
            alternative energy is needed to replace BBM, so that the chain of life on this earth can run well. Many
            non-BBM alternative energy can be developed, one of which is biogas. The utilization of biogas energy
            sources has begun to be developed at the Swadaya Pandan Mulyo Agriculture and Rural Training Center
            but the production capacity of the existing system is still not optimal, this is because the existing
            equipment is still manual and simple so extra energy is needed in order to continue producing biogas.
